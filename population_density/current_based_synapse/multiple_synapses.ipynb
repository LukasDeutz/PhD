    "# Stationary firing rate  for EI-Network of Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire neurons with current-based synapses\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we consider a two population network of Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons with one excitatory and one inhbitory population. Neurons receive on average $K_E$ excitatory and $K_I = g\\cdot K_E$ inhibtory connections. First, we look at the non realistic case that neurons are only connected by a single synapse. We will then consider the more realistic case that neurons connect via multiple synapses and investigate how this changes the results. <br> Singe neuron dynamics are described by \n",

    "where $\\tau_m$ is the membrane time constant and $I$ is the input current the neuron receives from within the network. The contribution from excitatory postsynaptic neurons will be denoted as $I_E$ and from postsynaptic inhibitory neurons $I_I$ such that $I=I_E+I_I$. The excitatory current $I_E$ is given by the superposition of all individual currents triggered by spikes from excitatory \n",
