    "## Population density for current-based synapses\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we want to study the dynamics of neuronal networks of multiple populations using population density techniques. Our first objective is to generalize the method introduced in [1] to apply to current based-synapses instead of delta-synapses. This allows us to include different synaptic time constants for different connections types (e.g. excitatory and inhibitory).  \n",
