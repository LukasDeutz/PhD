For a population, we  assume that the statistics of the afferent current at a given time are identical for all neurons. Furthermore, we assume that the noise feld by each neuron is statistically independent. This is called the mean-field assumption.<br> \n",

Because the probability mass crossing the threshold is reinserted at reset, the flux makes a jump at $v=H$\n",
