abstract = {Diffusion processes have been applied with great success to model the dynamics of large populations throughout science, in particular biology. One advantage is that they bridge two different scales: the microscopic and the macroscopic one. Diffusion is a mathematical idealisation, however: it assumes vanishingly small state changes at the microscopic level. In real biological systems this is often not the case. The differential Chapman-Kolmogorov equation is more appropriate to model population dynamics that is not well described by drift and diffusion alone. Here, the method of characteristics is used to transform deterministic dynamics away and find a coordinate frame where this equation reduces to a Master equation. There is no longer a drift term, and solution methods there are insensitive to density gradients, making the method suitable for jump processes with arbitrary jump sizes. Moreover, its solution is universal: it no longer depends explicitly on the deterministic system. We demonstrate the technique on simple models of neuronal populations. Surprisingly, it is suitable for fast neural dynamics, even though in the new coordinate frame state space may expand rapidly towards infinity. We demonstrate universality: the method is applicable to any one dimensional neural model and show this on populations of leaky- and quadratic-integrate-and-fire neurons. In the diffusive limit, excellent approximations of Fokker-Planck equations are achieved. Nothing in the approach is particular to neuroscience, and the neural models are simple enough to serve as an example of dynamical systems that demonstrates the method.},

abstract = {Clocks tick, bridges and skyscrapers vibrate, neuronal networks oscillate. Are neuronal oscillations an inevitable by-product, similar to bridge vibrations, or an essential part of the brain's design? Mammalian cortical neurons form behavior-dependent oscillating networks of various sizes, which span five orders of magnitude in frequency. These oscillations are phylogenetically preserved, suggesting that they are functionally relevant. Recent findings indicate that network oscillations bias input selection, temporally link neurons into assemblies, and facilitate synaptic plasticity, mechanisms that cooperatively support temporal representation and long-term consolidation of information.},

@article{Amit1997,
abstract = {We investigate self-sustaining stable states (attractors) in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons. First, we study the stability of spontaneous activity in an unstructured network. It is shown that the stochastic background activity, of 1-5 spikes/s, is unstable if all neurons are excitatory. On the other hand, spontaneous activity becomes self-stabilizing in presence of local inhibition, given reasonable values of the parameters of the network. Second, in a network sustaining physiological spontaneous rates, we study the effect of learning in a local module, expressed in synaptic modifications in specific populations of synapses. We find that if the average synaptic potentiation (LTP) is too low, no stimulus specific activity manifests itself in the delay period. Instead, following the presentation and removal of any stimulus there is, in the local module, a delay activity in which all neurons selective (responding visually) to any of the stimuli presented for learning have rates which gradually increase with the amplitude of synaptic potentiation. When the average LTP increases beyond a critical value, specific local attractors (stable states) appear abruptly against the background of the global uniform spontaneous attractor. In this case the local module has two available types of collective delay activity: if the stimulus is unfamiliar, the activity is spontaneous; if it is similar to a learned stimulus, delay activity is selective. These new attractors reflect the synaptic structure developed during learning. In each of them a small population of neurons have elevated rates, which depend on the strength of LTP. The remaining neurons of the module have their activity at spontaneous rates. The predictions made in this paper could be checked by single unit recordings in delayed response experiments.},

The power spectrum of nu (t) in an asynchronous state is computed and compared to simulations. We calculate the interpopulations transfer functions and show how synaptic interaction modulates the otherwise low-pass filter with resonances which go well beyond the filter's cut (omega approximately nu) , allowing efficient information transmission on very short time scales determined by spike transmission delays. The saddle-node instability of the asynchronous state is studied and a simple exact dependence of the stability condition on the current-to-rate gain functions is derived, by which self-couplings (EE and II) decrease stability while mutual interaction (EI and IE) favor stability.},

abstract = {A dynamical equation is derived for the spike emission rate nu(t) of a homogeneous network of integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons in a mean-field theoretical framework, where the activity of the single cell depends both on the mean afferent current (the "field") and on its fluctuations. Finite-size effects are taken into account, by a stochastic extension of the dynamical equation for the nu; their effect on the collective activity is studied in detail. Conditions for the local stability of the collective activity are shown to be naturally and simply expressed in terms of (the slope of) the single neuron, static, current-to-rate transfer function. In the framework of the local analysis, we studied the spectral properties of the time-dependent collective activity of the finite network in an asynchronous state; finite-size fluctuations act as an ongoing self-stimulation, which probes the spectral structure of the system on a wide frequency range. The power spectrum of nu exhibits modes ranging from very high frequency (depending on spike transmission delays), which are responsible for instability, to oscillations at a few Hz, direct expression of the diffusion process describing the population dynamics. The latter "diffusion" slow modes do not contribute to the stability conditions. Their characteristic times govern the transient response of the network; these reaction times also exhibit a simple dependence on the slope of the neuron transfer function. We speculate on the possible relevance of our results for the change in the characteristic response time of a neural population during the learning process which shapes the synaptic couplings, thereby affecting the slope of the transfer function. There is remarkable agreement of the theoretical predictions with simulations of a network of IF neurons with a constant leakage term for the membrane potential.},

Depending on the issues addressed and the degree of realism incorporated in the simulated neurons, a wide range of different population dynamics formulations can be appropriate. Here we present a common mathematical structure that these various formulations share and that implies dynamical behaviors that they have in common. This underlying structure serves as a guide toward efficient means of simulation. As an example, we derive the general population firing-rate frequency-response and show how it may be used effectively to address a broad range of interacting-population response and stability problems. A few specific cases will be worked out. A summary of this work appears at the end, before the appendix.},

@article{Renart2010,
abstract = {Correlated spiking is often observed in cortical circuits, but its functional role is controversial. It is believed that correlations are a consequence of shared inputs between nearby neurons and could severely constrain information decoding. Here we show theoretically that recurrent neural networks can generate an asynchronous state characterized by arbitrarily low mean spiking correlations despite substantial amounts of shared input. In this state, spontaneous fluctuations in the activity of excitatory and inhibitory populations accurately track each other, generating negative correlations in synaptic currents which cancel the effect of shared input. Near-zero mean correlations were seen experimentally in recordings from rodent neocortex in vivo. Our results suggest a reexamination of the sources underlying observed correlations and their functional consequences for information processing.},

abstract = {Functional interactions between neurons in vivo are often quantified by cross-correlation functions (CCFs) between their spike trains. It is therefore essential to understand quantitatively how CCFs are shaped by different factors, such as connectivity, synaptic parameters, and background activity. Here, we study the CCF between two neurons using analytical calculations and numerical simulations. We quantify the role of synaptic parameters, such as peak conductance, decay time, and reversal potential, and analyze how various patterns of connectivity influence CCF shapes. In particular, we find that the symmetry of the CCF distinguishes in general, but not always, the case of shared inputs between two neurons from the case in which they are directly synaptically connected. We systematically examine the influence of background synaptic inputs from the surrounding network that set the baseline firing statistics of the neurons and modulate their response properties. We find that variations in the background noise modify the amplitude of the cross-correlation function as strongly as variations of synaptic strength. In particular, we show that the postsynaptic neuron spiking regularity has a pronounced influence on CCF amplitude. This suggests an efficient and flexible mechanism for modulating functional interactions.},

In the limit when the number of neurons N tends to infinity,the network exhibits a sharp transition between a stationary and an oscillatory global activity regime where neurons are weakly synchronized. The activity becomes oscillatory when the inhibitory feedback is strong enough. The period of the global oscillation is found to be mainly controlled by synaptic times, but depends also on the characteristics of the external input. In large but finite networks, the analysis shows that global oscillations of finite coherence time generically exist both above and below the critical inhibition threshold. Their characteristics are determined as functions of systems parameters, in these two different regimes. The results are found to be in good agreement with numerical simulations.},

This permits a statistical regression analysis of the intensity of a recurrent event allowing for complicated censoring patterns and time dependent covariates. Furthermore, this formulation gives rise to proofs with very simple structure using martingale techniques for the asymptotic properties of the estimators from such a model.

@article{Bernander1991,
abstract = {The standard one-dimensional Rall cable model assumes that the electrotonic structure of neurons does not change in response to synaptic input. This model is used in a great number of both theoretical and anatomical-physiological structure-function studies. In particular, the membrane time constant, tau m, the somatic input resistance, Rin, and the electrotonic length are used to characterize single cells. However, these studies do not take into account that neurons are embedded in a network of spontaneously active cells. Synapses from these cells will contribute significantly to the membrane conductance, especially if recent evidence of very high specific membrane resistance, Rm = 100 k omega.cm2, is taken into account. We numerically simulated the electrical behavior of an anatomically reconstructed layer V cortical pyramidal cell receiving input from 4000 excitatory and 1000 inhibitory cells firing spontaneously at 0-7 Hz. We found that, over this range of synaptic background activity, tau m and Rin change by a factor of 10 (80-7 msec, 110-14 M omega) and the electrotonic length of the cell changes by a factor of 3. We show that this significantly changes the response of the cell to temporal desynchronized versus temporal synchronized synaptic input distributed throughout the neuron. Thus, the global activity of the network can control how individual cells perform spatial and temporal integration.},

We explore an application of two-dimensional (2-D) PDF methods to simulating electrical activity in networks of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons.We formulate a pair of coupled partial differential-integral equations describing the evolution of PDFs for neurons in non-refractory and refractory pools. The population firing rate is given by the total flux of probability across the threshold voltage. We use an operator-splitting method to reduce computation time. We report on speed and accuracy of PDF results and compare them to those from direct, Monte-Carlo simulations.We compute temporal frequency response functions for the transduction from the rate of postsynaptic input to population firing rate, and examine its dependence on background synaptic input rate. The behaviors in the1-D and 2-D cases--corresponding to instantaneous and non-instantaneous synaptic kinetics, respectively--differ markedly from those for a somewhat different transduction: from injected current input to population firing rate output (Brunel et al. 2001; Fourcaud {\&} Brunel 2002).We extend our method by adding inhibitory input, consider a 3-D to 2-D dimension reduction method, demonstrate its limitations, and suggest directions for future study.},

abstract = {Differential images of ocular dominance, acquired by comparing responses to the two eyes, reveal dark and light bands where cortical cells are dominated by the right and left eyes. These include most (but not all) histochemically stained cytochrome oxidase blobs in their centers. Differential images of orientation, acquired by comparing responses to orthogonal orientations, reveal dark and light bands that are reminiscent of the "orientation columns" reported earlier, on the basis of 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) autoradiograms (Hubel et al., 1978). However, they are shorter and more fragmented because they do not include regions lacking selectivity for orientation. Even though these "bands" derive from orientation-selective areas, comparisons with differential images of other orientations reveal that regions along their centers prefer different orientations. Hence, the orientation preferences inferred from "bands" in single differential images, or single 2DG autoradiograms, are not necessarily incorrect. Interactions between ocular dominance and orientation were investigated by comparing differential images of orientation obtained with binocular and monocular stimulation, as well as by comparing differential images of ocular dominance obtained with different orientations. In both cases, the elicited interactions were minimal, indicating a remarkable and unexpected independence that subsequent experiments revealed arises, at least in part, from a lateral segregation of regions most selective for one eye and regions most selective for one orientation, in the centers and edges of ocular dominance columns. Since this can also be viewed as a lateral correlation between binocularity and orientation selectivity, it fits with the simultaneous emergence of these properties in layers receiving input from layer 4c, and suggests that each of these properties requires the other.},

abstract = {Maps of orientation preference and selectivity, inferred from differential images of orientation (Blasdel, 1992), reveal linear organizations in patches, 0.5-1.0 mm across, where orientation selectivities are high, and where preferred orientations rotate linearly along one axis while remaining constant along the other. Most of these linear zones lie between the centers of adjacent ocular dominance columns, with their short iso-orientation slabs oriented perpendicular, in regions enjoying the greatest binocular overlap. These two-dimensional linear zones are segregated by one- and zero-dimensional discontinuities that are particularly abundant in the centers of ocular dominance columns, and that are also correlated with cytochrome oxidase-rich zones within them. Discontinuities smaller than 90 degrees extend in one dimension, as fractures, while discontinuities greater than 90 degrees are confined to points, in the form of singularities, that are generated when orientation preferences rotate continuously through +/- 180 degrees along circular paths. The continuous rotations through 180 degrees imply that direction preferences are not organized laterally in striate cortex. And they also ensure that preferences for all orientations converge at each singularity, with perpendicular orientations represented uniquely close together on opposite sides. The periodic interspersing of linear zones and singularities suggests that orientation preferences are organized by at least two competing schemes. They are optimized for linearity, along with selectivity and binocularity, in the linear zones, and they are optimized for density near singularities. Since upper-layer neurons are likely to have similarly sized dendritic fields in all regions (Lund and Yoshioka, 1991), those in the linear zones should receive precise information about narrowly constrained orientations, while those near singularities should receive coarse information about all orientations--very different inputs that suggest different perceptual functions.},

abstract = {1. We compared gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated responses of identified pyramidal cells and fast spiking interneurons in layer V of visual cortical slices from young rats (P11-14). 2. The frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) was similar in pyramidal cells and interneurons (1.7 vs. 1.9 Hz). For events with 10-90{\%} rise times less than 0.9 ms, no significant differences were found in mean amplitude (61 vs. 65 pA), mean rise time (0.58 vs. 0.61 ms), or the first time constant of decay (tau 1, 6.4 vs. 6.5 ms) between pyramidal cells and interneurons. The second decay time constant (tau 2) was significantly longer in interneurons than in pyramidal cells (49 vs. 22 ms). The difference in sIPSC decay kinetics between two cell types also existed in adult rats (P36-42), suggesting the kinetic difference in not due to differential development of GABAA receptors in these cell types. 3. The decay kinetics of monosynaptic evoked IPSCs were also longer in interneurons. As in the case of sIPSCs, the difference was accounted for by the second decay time constant. tau 1 and tau 2 were, respectively, 13 and 64 ms for interneurons and 12 and 47 ms for pyramidal cells. 4. Cell-attached patch recordings revealed that the mean open time for single Cl- channels in response to 2 microM GABA was significantly longer in interneurons than pyramidal cells (5.0 vs. 2.8 ms). The chord conductance of these channels in interneurons (12 pS) was significantly smaller than in pyramidal cells (15 pS). Single channel currents reversed polarity when the pipette potential was approximately -10 mV for both cell types. 5. These results show that there is a functional diversity of GABAA receptors in electrophysiologically and morphologically identified cortical pyramidal cells and interneurons. This diversity might derive from the different molecular composition of the receptors in these two cell types.},

@article{Sah1990,
abstract = {1. We studied excitatory synaptic currents activated by stimulation of Schaffer collateral-commissural fibres and recorded from interneurones in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices using whole-cell techniques. 2. Interneurones were identified by their location outside the cell layer and their morphology as seen with differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy and by filling with Lucifer Yellow (LY). 3. The excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) had a fast, voltage-insensitive component and a slow component which had a region of negative slope resistance between -70 and -40 mV. The slow voltage-dependent component was abolished by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) 50 microM) which had little effect on the fast component. Conversely, the fast component was abolished by the non-NMDA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitoquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; 10 microM), which had no effect on the slow component. 4. The rise time of the fast component ranged from 1 to 3 ms and the decay time constant ranged from 3 to 15 ms. The rise time of the slow component ranged from 5 to 11 ms and the decay time constant ranged from 50 to 100 ms. 5. It is concluded that although the morphology of the excitatory synapses onto interneurones differs considerably from those onto pyramidal cells, their electrophysiological and pharmacological properties are very similar.},

@article{Hansel2002,
abstract = {The width of the orientation tuning curves of the spike response of neurons in V1 is invariant to contrast. This property constrains the possible mechanisms underlying orientation selectivity. It has been suggested that noise circumvents the iceberg effect that would prevent contrast invariance in the purely feedforward mechanism. Here we investigate systematically how noise contributes to the contrast invariance of orientation tuning curves in V1. We study three models of increasing complexity: a simple threshold-linear firing rate model, a leaky integrate-and-fire model, and a conductance-based model. We show that the noise transmutes the threshold nonlinearity of the input-output relationships into an approximate power law without a threshold within some firing rate range. This implies that, under certain conditions which are derived here, the tuning of the neuron output is approximately contrast invariant. In particular we show that this mechanism for contrast invariance requires that the neuron firing rate must not be too large and that increasing or lowering the contrast too much destroys this invariance. We also show that if this mechanism operates in V1, the spike response, R, and average voltage response V of the neurons in V1 should vary with the contrast, C, according to R(C)gamma proportional to V(C)gamma. The exponent gamma can be estimated from the amount by which the spike tuning curve is sharpened with respect to the voltage tuning curves of the neurons. This prediction does not depend on the specifics of the model and can be tested experimentally.},

@article{Brunel2003,
abstract = {We calculate the firing rate of the quadratic integrate-and-fire neuron in response to a colored noise input current. Such an input current is a good approximation to the noise due to the random bombardment of spikes, with the correlation time of the noise corresponding to the decay time of the synapses. The key parameter that determines the firing rate is the ratio of the correlation time of the colored noise, tau(s), to the neuronal time constant, tau(m). We calculate the firing rate exactly in two limits: when the ratio, tau(s)/tau(m), goes to zero (white noise) and when it goes to infinity. The correction to the short correlation time limit is O(tau(s)/tau(m)), which is qualita tively different from that of the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron, where the correction is O( radical tau(s)/tau(m)). The difference is due to the different boundary conditions of the probability density function of the membrane potential of the neuron at firing threshold. The correction to the long correlation time limit is O(tau(m)/tau(s)). By combining the short and long correlation time limits, we derive an expression that provides a good approximation to the firing rate over the whole range of tau(s)/tau(m) in the suprathreshold regime-that is, in a regime in which the average current is sufficient to make the cell fire. In the subthreshold regime, the expression breaks down somewhat when tau(s) becomes large compared to tau(m).},

@article{Zador1998,
abstract = {Cortical neurons in the waking brain fire highly irregular, seemingly random, spike trains in response to constant sensory stimulation, whereas in vitro they fire regularly in response to constant current injection. To test whether, as has been suggested, this high in vivo variability could be due to the postsynaptic currents generated by independent synaptic inputs, we injected synthetic synaptic current into neocortical neurons in brain slices. We report that independent inputs cannot account for this high variability, but this variability can be explained by a simple alternative model of the synaptic drive in which inputs arrive synchronously. Our results suggest that synchrony may be important in the neural code by providing a means for encoding signals with high temporal fidelity over a population of neurons.},
