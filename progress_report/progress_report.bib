abstract = {Diffusion processes have been applied with great success to model the dynamics of large populations throughout science, in particular biology. One advantage is that they bridge two different scales: the microscopic and the macroscopic one. Diffusion is a mathematical idealisation, however: it assumes vanishingly small state changes at the microscopic level. In real biological systems this is often not the case. The differential Chapman-Kolmogorov equation is more appropriate to model population dynamics that is not well described by drift and diffusion alone. Here, the method of characteristics is used to transform deterministic dynamics away and find a coordinate frame where this equation reduces to a Master equation. There is no longer a drift term, and solution methods there are insensitive to density gradients, making the method suitable for jump processes with arbitrary jump sizes. Moreover, its solution is universal: it no longer depends explicitly on the deterministic system. We demonstrate the technique on simple models of neuronal populations. Surprisingly, it is suitable for fast neural dynamics, even though in the new coordinate frame state space may expand rapidly towards infinity. We demonstrate universality: the method is applicable to any one dimensional neural model and show this on populations of leaky- and quadratic-integrate-and-fire neurons. In the diffusive limit, excellent approximations of Fokker-Planck equations are achieved. Nothing in the approach is particular to neuroscience, and the neural models are simple enough to serve as an example of dynamical systems that demonstrates the method.},

abstract = {Clocks tick, bridges and skyscrapers vibrate, neuronal networks oscillate. Are neuronal oscillations an inevitable by-product, similar to bridge vibrations, or an essential part of the brain's design? Mammalian cortical neurons form behavior-dependent oscillating networks of various sizes, which span five orders of magnitude in frequency. These oscillations are phylogenetically preserved, suggesting that they are functionally relevant. Recent findings indicate that network oscillations bias input selection, temporally link neurons into assemblies, and facilitate synaptic plasticity, mechanisms that cooperatively support temporal representation and long-term consolidation of information.},

@article{Amit1997,
abstract = {We investigate self-sustaining stable states (attractors) in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons. First, we study the stability of spontaneous activity in an unstructured network. It is shown that the stochastic background activity, of 1-5 spikes/s, is unstable if all neurons are excitatory. On the other hand, spontaneous activity becomes self-stabilizing in presence of local inhibition, given reasonable values of the parameters of the network. Second, in a network sustaining physiological spontaneous rates, we study the effect of learning in a local module, expressed in synaptic modifications in specific populations of synapses. We find that if the average synaptic potentiation (LTP) is too low, no stimulus specific activity manifests itself in the delay period. Instead, following the presentation and removal of any stimulus there is, in the local module, a delay activity in which all neurons selective (responding visually) to any of the stimuli presented for learning have rates which gradually increase with the amplitude of synaptic potentiation. When the average LTP increases beyond a critical value, specific local attractors (stable states) appear abruptly against the background of the global uniform spontaneous attractor. In this case the local module has two available types of collective delay activity: if the stimulus is unfamiliar, the activity is spontaneous; if it is similar to a learned stimulus, delay activity is selective. These new attractors reflect the synaptic structure developed during learning. In each of them a small population of neurons have elevated rates, which depend on the strength of LTP. The remaining neurons of the module have their activity at spontaneous rates. The predictions made in this paper could be checked by single unit recordings in delayed response experiments.},

abstract = {The dynamic mean-field approach we recently developed is extended to study the dynamics of population emission rates nu (t) for a finite network of coupled excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons. The power spectrum of nu (t) in an asynchronous state is computed and compared to simulations. We calculate the interpopulations transfer functions and show how synaptic interaction modulates the otherwise low-pass filter with resonances which go well beyond the filter's cut (omega approximately nu) , allowing efficient information transmission on very short time scales determined by spike transmission delays. The saddle-node instability of the asynchronous state is studied and a simple exact dependence of the stability condition on the current-to-rate gain functions is derived, by which self-couplings (EE and II) decrease stability while mutual interaction (EI and IE) favor stability.},

abstract = {A dynamical equation is derived for the spike emission rate nu(t) of a homogeneous network of integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons in a mean-field theoretical framework, where the activity of the single cell depends both on the mean afferent current (the "field") and on its fluctuations. Finite-size effects are taken into account, by a stochastic extension of the dynamical equation for the nu; their effect on the collective activity is studied in detail. Conditions for the local stability of the collective activity are shown to be naturally and simply expressed in terms of (the slope of) the single neuron, static, current-to-rate transfer function. In the framework of the local analysis, we studied the spectral properties of the time-dependent collective activity of the finite network in an asynchronous state; finite-size fluctuations act as an ongoing self-stimulation, which probes the spectral structure of the system on a wide frequency range. The power spectrum of nu exhibits modes ranging from very high frequency (depending on spike transmission delays), which are responsible for instability, to oscillations at a few Hz, direct expression of the diffusion process describing the population dynamics. The latter "diffusion" slow modes do not contribute to the stability conditions. Their characteristic times govern the transient response of the network; these reaction times also exhibit a simple dependence on the slope of the neuron transfer function. We speculate on the possible relevance of our results for the change in the characteristic response time of a neural population during the learning process which shapes the synaptic couplings, thereby affecting the slope of the transfer function. There is remarkable agreement of the theoretical predictions with simulations of a network of IF neurons with a constant leakage term for the membrane potential.},
